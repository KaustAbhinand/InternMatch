# üéØ PM Internship Scheme - Matching Model Explanation

## üìä **Overview**
The PM Internship Scheme uses a **weighted scoring algorithm** to match candidates with internships based on multiple criteria. The system calculates a match percentage (0-100%) by evaluating various factors.

## üîß **Matching Algorithm**

### **Model Type: Weighted Multi-Criteria Scoring**
- **Algorithm**: Custom weighted scoring system
- **Machine Learning**: TF-IDF vectorization for text similarity (optional)
- **Scoring Range**: 0-100% (fixed)
- **Decision Making**: Rule-based with weighted factors

## üìà **Matching Criteria & Weights**

### **1. Education Level Match (30% weight)**
```python
# Exact match: 100% of education weight
if candidate_education == internship_education:
    score += 0.3 * 1.0

# Higher education applying for lower requirement: 80% of education weight
elif candidate_education == 'Post Graduate' and internship_education == 'Graduate':
    score += 0.3 * 0.8
```

**Examples:**
- Graduate applying for Graduate position: 30 points
- Post Graduate applying for Graduate position: 24 points
- Graduate applying for Post Graduate position: 0 points

### **2. Skills Match (25% weight)**
```python
# Calculate skills overlap percentage
candidate_skills = set(candidate_profile['skills'])
required_skills = set(internship['skills_required'])
skills_match_ratio = len(candidate_skills ‚à© required_skills) / len(required_skills)
score += 0.25 * skills_match_ratio
```

**Examples:**
- Candidate has 3 out of 4 required skills: 18.75 points (75% of 25%)
- Candidate has all required skills: 25 points (100% of 25%)
- Candidate has no required skills: 0 points

### **3. Sector Interest Match (20% weight)**
```python
# Check if candidate's sector interests match internship sector
candidate_interests = candidate_profile['sector_interests']
internship_sector = internship['sector']

# Exact match: 100% of sector weight
if any(interest.lower() in internship_sector.lower() for interest in candidate_interests):
    score += 0.2 * 1.0

# Keyword match: 50% of sector weight
elif keyword_match_found:
    score += 0.2 * 0.5
```

**Examples:**
- Candidate interested in "Technology" applying for "Technology" internship: 20 points
- Candidate interested in "Digital Marketing" applying for "Technology" internship: 10 points (keyword match)
- No sector match: 0 points

### **4. Location Preference Match (15% weight)**
```python
candidate_location = candidate_profile['location_preference']
internship_location = internship['location']

# Exact city match: 100% of location weight
if candidate_location.lower() in internship_location.lower():
    score += 0.15 * 1.0

# State match: 60% of location weight
elif state_match_found:
    score += 0.15 * 0.6

# Remote work match: 80% of location weight
elif both_prefer_remote:
    score += 0.15 * 0.8
```

**Examples:**
- Candidate wants "Mumbai" and internship is in "Mumbai": 15 points
- Candidate wants "Maharashtra" and internship is in "Mumbai": 9 points
- Both prefer remote work: 12 points

### **5. Career Goal Match (15% weight)**
```python
# Check if internship aligns with candidate's career goal
candidate_goal = candidate_profile['career_goal']
internship_text = internship['title'] + ' ' + internship['description']

# Keyword matching for career goals
goal_keywords = {
    'Software Developer': ['software', 'developer', 'programming', 'coding', 'tech'],
    'Data Analyst': ['data', 'analyst', 'analytics', 'research', 'statistics'],
    'Digital Marketer': ['marketing', 'digital', 'social media', 'content', 'brand'],
    # ... more career goals
}

if keyword_found_in_internship_text:
    score += 0.15 * 0.3  # 30% of goal weight per keyword match
```

**Examples:**
- Candidate wants "Software Developer" and internship mentions "programming": 4.5 points
- Multiple keyword matches: Up to 15 points
- No goal alignment: 0 points

### **6. Experience Level Match (10% weight)**
```python
candidate_experience = candidate_profile['experience_level']
internship_experience = internship['experience_level']

# Exact match: 100% of experience weight
if candidate_experience == internship_experience:
    score += 0.1 * 1.0

# Higher experience applying for lower requirement: 80% of experience weight
elif candidate_experience == 'Intermediate' and internship_experience == 'Beginner':
    score += 0.1 * 0.8
```

**Examples:**
- Beginner applying for Beginner position: 10 points
- Intermediate applying for Beginner position: 8 points
- Beginner applying for Advanced position: 0 points

## üßÆ **Final Score Calculation**

### **Step 1: Calculate Raw Score**
```python
raw_score = (education_score + skills_score + sector_score + 
             location_score + goal_score + experience_score)
```

### **Step 2: Calculate Maximum Possible Score**
```python
max_score = 0.3 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.1 = 1.15
```

### **Step 3: Normalize to 0-1 Range**
```python
normalized_score = raw_score / max_score
```

### **Step 4: Convert to Percentage**
```python
match_percentage = min(max(normalized_score * 100, 0), 100)
```

## üìä **Example Calculation**

### **Candidate Profile:**
- **Education**: Graduate
- **Skills**: ['Digital Marketing', 'Social Media', 'Content Writing']
- **Sector Interests**: ['Technology']
- **Location Preference**: 'Mumbai'
- **Career Goal**: 'Digital Marketer'
- **Experience Level**: 'Beginner'

### **Internship:**
- **Education Required**: Graduate
- **Skills Required**: ['Digital Marketing', 'Social Media', 'Analytics', 'Content Writing']
- **Sector**: 'Technology'
- **Location**: 'Mumbai, Maharashtra'
- **Experience Level**: 'Beginner'

### **Score Calculation:**
1. **Education Match**: 1.0 √ó 0.3 = 0.3 (30 points)
2. **Skills Match**: (3/4) √ó 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75 points)
3. **Sector Match**: 1.0 √ó 0.2 = 0.2 (20 points)
4. **Location Match**: 1.0 √ó 0.15 = 0.15 (15 points)
5. **Goal Match**: 0.3 √ó 0.15 = 0.045 (4.5 points)
6. **Experience Match**: 1.0 √ó 0.1 = 0.1 (10 points)

**Total Raw Score**: 0.9825  
**Max Possible Score**: 1.15  
**Normalized Score**: 0.9825 / 1.15 = 0.855  
**Final Match Percentage**: 85.5% ‚Üí **86%**

## üîç **Advanced Features**

### **TF-IDF Text Similarity (Optional)**
```python
# Uses scikit-learn for advanced text matching
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Create text representations
internship_text = title + description + skills + sector
candidate_text = skills + interests + goal

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(candidate_vector, internship_vector)
```
